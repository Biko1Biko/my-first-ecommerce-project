Git =  helps us tracks changes in our code
Repository = a folder when git is tracking chnanges

.gitignore = tells git which files and folders to ingoner (not to track changes)

Routing = create multiples pages in React
Routing lest us create multiple pages using 1 HTML file.

React is single page application (spa)
 = we only have 1 HTML file
 = we use React to create multiple pages


 Link elements <a> reload the page

 We use the <link> element in React Router because it lets us move between pages inside a single application without reloading the whole web page 

when using react-router use <Link> instead of "a"
<Link> = got to another page without reloading

            Backend
    server is a computer or program that provide resource or service to othe computers over network

    type of server 
        - web server
        -Database server
        -File server

    Backend is the part of an application thar runs on the server and handles logic, database, authentication and data processing
 Data Fetching = get data from the backend (using our code)

 fetch is a function alos called an API method built into JavaScript that allows you to make network requests fetch 
 you use fetch() to get data from a server or API usually over the internet

 synchronous Code is code run line by line.
 Each line waits for the previous  one to finish

 fetch becomes asynchronous because it is used to request data from a server over the internet adn that process takes time

 A web server is a computer or software that deliver web pages to users through the internet

 HTTP request coming from browsers
 HTTPS responses sending back HTML CSS JS images API data

 exampe of web server Apache

 database server is a computer or software that stores, manages and retrieves data

 Frontend the frontend is what users see in the browser: HTML CSS, JavaScript anyone one with your url can access it if it's hosted on the internet

 backend the backend is your server that hadle logic, database, authentication, etc it does not have to be public. it can run
    only on your local computer


    fetch() return a promise

    promise = lets us wait for asynchronous code to finish

    fetch() send the request;

    frontend Hey backend give the users


    then() receives the response;


    fetch is synchronous function

    .then() is method used to handle the result of a promise.

    JSON is string representaion of an object or array

    axios is a popular javaScirpt library for making https requests but with more features and easier syntax

    axios = cleanr way to make request to the backend
